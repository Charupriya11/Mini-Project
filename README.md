# Mini-Project 
Image Classification of Dogs and Cats using KNeighbors Classification algorithm (KNN)
# Steps in ML
1. Gather Data (Use Bing Downloader)
2. Preprocess data
  a. Scale down the image to specific value
  b. Convert into a Single Dimension Array- Flattening of an image
  c. Creating dataframe by iterating through the images
3. Apply any classification algorithm with best parameters using GridSearchCV
4. Evaluate the model using Confusion Matrix and classification report
5. Predict for any new image

These procedures were used for Mini-Project

Thank you
